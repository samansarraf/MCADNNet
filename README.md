# MCADNNet
Deep learning-based algorithm to classify MC AD and NC MRI and fMRI data
# Image converter
The image converter script decomposes fMRI 4D data into 2D PNG slices.
This script requires OpenCV and Nibabel as prerequirests.
OpenCV is a computer vision library providing an extensive sets of functionalities for image processing, computer vision and machine learning.
Nibabel is a library to manipulate and process neuroimaging data.

## Installation
pip install opencv-python
pip install nibabel
